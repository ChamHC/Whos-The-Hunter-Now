# Who's The Hunter Now?
Who's The Hunter Now? is a local multiplayer 2D platformer game revolves around the concept of Chase Tagging, where players alternate between being the hunter and the hunted.

## Overview
The Hunted navigates through an arena, trying to reach the portal while being relentlessly hunted by The Hunter. Upon reaching the portal, The Hunted switches role and become The Hunter. 

The dynamics of the game shift as the previous hunter now becomes The Hunted. The new Hunted must now quickly adapt and navigate to a new portal, allowing him to reclaim his role as The Hunter. This cycle continues until one player emerges victorious. 

Throughout the game, players will encounter various random tools placed in the arena, providing opportunities to outmaneuver and outplay their opponents in this intense game of chase and strategy.
